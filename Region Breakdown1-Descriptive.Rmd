# Introduction 
After reading several studies on the status of women's sentencing in the US, one key phenomenon stood out: the intersection of gender, Hispanic identity, drug offenses, and border districts. 

This report is structured in three categories, where each category compounds on the previous: 
1. Location: The difference in sentence length in southern/border districts near Mexico. 
2. Variation by type of crime
3. Demographic disparity bar graphs, for border districts only


# Location 

This topic came to our attention in Fishman & Schazenbach (2012). Fischman & Schazenbach (2012)did not specifically focus on gender, but they did examine Hispanic identity along with border districts. They noted that Arizona, Southern California, New Mexico, Texas South, and Texas West had atypically large caseload pressure. In this same study, they argued Hispanic offenders faced larger sentences as a result of racial/ethnic bias. 

These trends are reflected throughout the literature, which often notes that disparity persists southern/border districts near Mexico. In a 2012 TRAC report, Texas North, Georgia North, Virginia East, Florida North, and Texas West had some of the largest differences between judges. Other border districts in the top 10 include Louisiana West and Florida Middle. Interestingly, another border district, California South had the smallest difference. TRAC specifically stated that Texas North "[sentencing] variation [was] hard to explain" due to large variances. Holland and Prohaska (2018) stated women of color received shorter sentences than white women, and that women in southern and border districts received significantly longer sentences. Topaz, Ning, and Ciocanel (2023) reported that at the district level there were significant differences between minority defendants and white defendants. 

These studies consistently presented trends among southern/border districts despite their varied themes and initial goals. As a result, we decided to take a closer look at border districts. Among defendants, we were primarily interested in the sentencing differences between men and women, while also addressing the genderâ€™s intersectionality with race. Though most legal academics have concluded almost no difference exists between male and female sentencing decisions overall, the field cannot agree where there is possible deviation. Rodriguez, Curry, and Lee (2006) found that women overall were less likely to be sentenced and if so, received shorter sentences than men. Goulette, Wooldredge, and Lawrence (2015) found that the intersection of race and gender impacted bond amounts, and minority females received higher bond amounts than White women, and specific crimes (i.e."rape, robbery, burglary, theft, fraud, drugs, and domestic violence/nonsupport") significantly impacted bond amounts as well. With all these patterns, we decided to examine how region, offense, and gender interact.

## Distribution of Sentences 
```{r}
# ggplot(data = district, aes(x = districtName, y = SENSPLT0)) +
#   geom_boxplot() 

boxplot(SENSPLT0 ~ districtName, data = district, 
        outline = FALSE, las = 2, ylab = "", xlab = '',cex.axis = .7)
title('Distribution of Sentence Lengths by District')
#does not include outliers 

```
*H0: All boxes would be of equal widths and have the same average sentence lengths. This means that the black bars would be all aligned, and the ranges would also be exactly the same.*
*H1: The boxes would not be of equal widths with evenly aligned black bars.* 

From the above visualization, we can note the following observations: 
1. The Northern Florida has far greater outliers than the other southern border districts. 

2. We can see that the black bar amongst all boxes is at about the same height compared to each other. This mean most sentence lengths for southern border districts average about the same, with outliers dragging out larger (i.e Northern Florida) or smaller (New Mexico) sentences. 

3. Northern and Eastern Texas have very different sentencing averages than their counterparts, Southern and Western Texas.

## Average Sentence, by Federal District and Period 

```{r full picture}
dem_avg <- function(df){
  df %>%
    group_by(districtName) %>%
    summarize(avg_sent = mean(SENSPLT0, na.rm=T))
}

list_periods <- list(postprotect, postbooker, postgall, postreport, present)

avg_sent_dem_tbl <- map(list_periods, dem_avg) %>%
  bind_rows(.id = "Period") %>%
  mutate(avg_sent = round(avg_sent),
         Period = recode(as.character(Period),
                         "1" = "Protect", "2" = "Booker", "3" = "Gall", "4" = "Post-Report", "5" = "Present")) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Period, values_from = avg_sent) %>%
  rename("Group" = districtName)

avg_sent_dem_tbl

#--- visualization 

df <- avg_sent_dem_tbl %>% 
  pivot_longer(!Group, names_to = 'period', values_to= 'avg_sent')

df$num_period <- as.numeric(factor(df$period, levels = c("Protect", "Booker", "Gall", "Post-Report", "Present")))

ggplot(data =df, aes(x = num_period, y = avg_sent, col = Group)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() + 
  scale_x_continuous(labels = c("Protect", "Booker", "Gall", "Post-Report", "Present")) + 
  xlab('Period') + 
  ylab('Avg Sentence Length') + 
  ggtitle("Avg Sentence Over Time")

```
*H0: There would be no distinguishing lines and/or trends between each district as average sentence lengths across districts should have been the same in each period.*
*H1: There are distinguishing lines and/or trends between each district.*

The chart above represents the average sentence length for each district over time, specifically between each period. Note that this includes all demographic types. We can draw three main points of interest: 

1. Northern and Eastern of Texas sentence length went up over time. 
2. The Northern of Florida average sentence length decreased the most after Booker and continued to do so in later periods. 
3. Within these southern border districts, there are two categories based on average sentence lengths. This specifically means that if we were to draw a straight line (say around 40) we would be able to cleanly divide the districts into two groups based on average sentence length over time. 

\newpage 

## Average Sentence Length 
```{r demographic }
df <- district%>%
  select(SENSPLT0, districtName, racesex_clean) %>%
  group_by(districtName, racesex_clean) %>%
  summarize(avg_sent = round(mean(SENSPLT0, na.rm = T))) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = racesex_clean, values_from = avg_sent)
df %>% flextable()

```

In this table, we present the numerical values for average sentence length spread out across district and demographic. Below, we visualize this information to better understand from a top down perspective what this table describes. 


## Average Sentence Length in each District

```{r}

#par(mfrow=c(2,2))
# Loop through rows and create bar charts
for (i in 1:nrow(df)) {
  # Select data for the current row
  current_row <- df[i, ]

  # Extract the fedNum and remove it from the data for plotting
  name <- current_row$districtName
  current_row <- current_row[-1]

  # Create a bar chart for the current row
  barplot(as.matrix(current_row), names.arg = names(current_row),
          main = paste("Avg Sentence Length in", name), legend = TRUE,cex.names= 0.6,las =2 )
}
```

*H0: Average sentence length across district would be exactly the same*
*H1: Average sentence length across district are not the same*

The series of visualizations above describe the average sentence length in each southern border district, broken down by demographic. The main notes to be aware of are the following: 

1. Other Female has a higher average sentence length than their male counterpart (Other Male) in Northern Texas. 
2. Northern and Eastern Texas have much higher average sentences for Hispanic populations compared to the rest of the southern border districts 
3. Other Male has a higher average sentence than Black Male in New Mexico 

## Average Sentence for each Demographic 

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
# Get the column names excluding the first column 
columns <- names(df)[-1]


# Loop through columns and create bar charts
for (col in columns) {
  # Create a bar chart for the current column
  barplot(df[[col]], names.arg = df$districtName,
          main = paste("Avg Sentence Length for", col),
          col = "steelblue", cex.names = .6, las=2)
}
```

*H0: Average sentence length across demographic are exactly the same*
*H1: Average sentence length across demographic are not the same*

1. Hispanic populations face higher average sentence lengths in Eastern and Northern Texas
2. Black Females have a noticably smaller average sentence length than their male counter part in Eastern Louisiana. 

# Crime Type 

## Average Sentence by Crime Type and Federal District 
```{r}
crime_df <- district%>% 
  select(SENSPLT0,  'District Name'=districtName  , crime_type) %>% 
  group_by(`District Name`, crime_type) %>% 
  summarize(avg_sent = round(mean(SENSPLT0, na.rm = T))) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = crime_type, values_from = avg_sent) 

crime_df %>% flextable()
```

The table above is the average sentence length by crime type and district. 



```{r}

#par(mfrow=c(2,2))
# Loop through rows and create bar charts
for (i in 1:nrow(crime_df)) {
  # Select data for the current row
  current_row <- crime_df[i, ]

  # Extract the fedNum and remove it from the data for plotting
  name <- current_row$`District Name`
  current_row <- current_row[-1]

  # Create a bar chart for the current row
  barplot(as.matrix(current_row), names.arg = names(current_row),
          ylab = "Avg Sentence Length in Months", 
          main = paste("Avg Sentence Length in", name), legend = TRUE,cex.names= 0.6,las =2 )
}
```

*H0: The average sentence length for each crime type remains consistent across all districts*
*H1: The average sentence length for each crime type is not consistent across all districts*

Despite a few slight variations, the average sentence length for each crime type remains mostly consistent across districts. 

## Average Sentence for each Demographic 

```{r}
#par(mfrow=c(2,2))
# Get the column names excluding the first column 
columns <- names(crime_df)[-1]
# Loop through columns and create bar charts
for (col in columns) {
  # Create a bar chart for the current column
  barplot(crime_df[[col]], names.arg = crime_df$`District Name`,
          main = paste("Avg Sentence Length for", col), ylab = "Avg Sentence in Months", 
          col = "goldenrod", cex.names = .6, las=2)
}
```
*H0: The average sentence length for each crime type remains consistent across all districts*
*H1: The average sentence length for each crime type is not consistent across all districts*


1. Drug Trafficking and Immigration have largest variation in average sentence length 
2. North Florida has lower than average sentence length for immigration than drug trafficking 
3. Sexual type crimes remain stagnant across all southern border districts

Because of this examination, we wanted to explore more into drug trafficking and immigration type offenses. 


## Drug Trafficking Sentence Length

```{r}
#par(mfrow = c(2,2))
drug <-  present %>% 
  filter(crime_type== "Drug Trafficking") %>% 
  select(crime_type, racesex_clean, districtName, SENSPLT0) %>% 
  group_by(racesex_clean, districtName) %>% 
  summarize(avg_sent = round(mean(SENSPLT0, na.rm = T))) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = districtName, values_from = avg_sent)


# Get the column names excluding the first column (fedNum)
columns <- names(drug)[-1]
# Loop through columns and create bar charts
for (col in columns) {
  # Create a bar chart for the current column
  barplot(drug[[col]], names.arg = drug$racesex_clean,
          main = paste("Drug Trafficking in", col), ylab = 'Avg Sentence in Months',
          col = "cornflowerblue", cex.names = .7, las = 2)
}
```
*H0: Sentencing lengths for drug trafficking offenses are the same across all demographics and districts.*
*H1: Sentencing lengths for drug trafficking offenses are not the same across all demographics and districts.* 

1. Hispanic Females have higher average drug trafficking sentences than Black Males in Northern Texas 
2. Hispanic Females and Hispanic Males have almost the same average drug trafficking sentencing lengths 


## Immigration Sentence Length

```{r}
#par(mfrow = c(2,2))
imm <-  present %>% 
  filter(crime_type== "Immigration") %>% 
  select(crime_type, racesex_clean, districtName, SENSPLT0) %>% 
  group_by(racesex_clean, districtName) %>% 
  summarize(avg_sent = round(mean(SENSPLT0, na.rm = T))) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = districtName, values_from = avg_sent)


# Get the column names excluding the first column (fedNum)
columns <- names(imm)[-1]
# Loop through columns and create bar charts
for (col in columns) {
  # Create a bar chart for the current column
  barplot(imm[[col]], names.arg = imm$racesex_clean,
          main = paste("Bar Chart for", col), ylab = 'Avg Sentence in Months',
          col = "coral", cex.names = .6, las = 2)
}
```
*H0: Sentencing lengths for immigration offenses are the same across all demographics and districts.*
*H1: Sentencing lengths for immigration offenses are not the same across all demographics and districts.* 

1. Hispanic Females have higher average immigration sentences than Black Males in Northern Texas
